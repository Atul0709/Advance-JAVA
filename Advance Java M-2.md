# Advance Java Module 2
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

Concept: JDBC is an industry-standard API (Application Programming Interface) that allows Java applications to connect to various databases and execute SQL statements. It provides a portable layer between your Java code and the database system, regardless of the specific database vendor.
JDBC Driver Types

JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver (deprecated): This driver (no longer recommended) relies on an installed ODBC driver to translate JDBC calls into ODBC function calls. While convenient for supporting multiple databases, it suffers from performance overhead.
Native-API Driver: This driver leverages the database vendor's native client-side libraries, offering better performance. However, it requires installation of the specific database's libraries on the client machine.
Network Protocol Driver (Partially Java Driver): This driver combines a Java portion with a native library on the server side. It communicates with the database using a network protocol like JDBC Thin or SOAP.
Thin Driver (Fully Java Driver): This driver is the most common and recommended type. It's written entirely in Java and communicates directly with the database server over a network protocol like JDBC Thin or SOAP. It offers portability and doesn't require installation of native libraries on the client side.
Example:
// Using a thin driver for MySQL (replace with your database details)
String driverClassName = "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver";
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
String username = "your_username";
String password = "your_password";

// Load the driver class (may be automatic depending on your environment)
Class.forName(driverClassName);

// Establish a connection
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);

// (Use connection object to execute statements, etc.)


JDBC Packages

java.sql: This package contains core JDBC classes and interfaces like Connection, Statement, ResultSet, and SQLException.
javax.sql: This package (optional) provides additional features like DataSource for connection pooling.
JDBC Process Overview

Load the JDBC Driver: Use Class.forName() to register the driver class with the DriverManager.
Establish a Database Connection: Use DriverManager.getConnection() to create a Connection object, providing the database URL, username, and password.
Create a Statement: Use connection.createStatement() to create a Statement object to execute SQL statements.
Execute a Query: Use methods like statement.executeQuery() for SELECT statements and statement.executeUpdate() for INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.
Process Results (if applicable): For SELECT statements, use methods on the ResultSet object (returned by executeQuery()) to iterate through results and retrieve data.
Close Resources: Close the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects in the reverse order of creation to release resources.
Database Connection

The Connection object represents a session with a database. It's used to create Statement objects and provides methods for managing transactions, isolation levels, and other connection properties.

JDBC-ODBC Bridge (deprecated)

While convenient for supporting multiple databases, the JDBC-ODBC bridge is discouraged due to performance overhead and potential compatibility issues. It's recommended to use the appropriate driver type for your specific database.

Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement

Statement: Used for executing simple SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
PreparedStatement: More efficient and secure for parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Placeholders (?) are used for dynamic values.
CallableStatement: Used for calling stored procedures, which are pre-compiled SQL code blocks on the database server.
Executing Queries using JDBC Connection
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();

// Example SELECT query
String query = "SELECT * FROM your_table";
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);

while (resultSet.next()) {
  int id = resultSet.getInt("id");
  String name = resultSet.getString("name");
  // Process data from each row
}

resultSet.close();
statement.close();
connection.close();

#Transactions

Transactions group multiple database operations (such as inserts, updates, and deletes) into a single unit of work. They ensure data consistency by either committing all changes in the transaction or rolling back all changes if any operation fails.

Autocommit: By default, JDBC connections are in autocommit mode, meaning each statement is automatically committed after execution.
Manual Commit: To control transactions, you can disable autocommit using connection.setAutoCommit(false). You then need to explicitly commit (connection.commit()) or rollback (connection.rollback()) the transaction.
Example with Transaction:
connection.setAutoCommit(false); // Disable autocommit

try {
  Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
  statement.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO your_table (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 30)");
  statement.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO your_table (name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 25)");

  connection.commit(); // Commit the transaction (if all statements succeed)
} catch (SQLException e) {
  connection.rollback(); // Rollback if any statement fails
  e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
  statement.close();
  connection.close();
}

Connection Pooling

Connection pooling improves performance and resource efficiency by maintaining a pool of pre-established connections that can be reused by multiple threads in your application. This avoids the overhead of creating and closing connections for each database interaction.

DataSource: The javax.sql.DataSource interface provides a standard way to obtain connections from a connection pool. You can configure a connection pool using a third-party library or a database server's built-in connection pooling mechanism.
Example (using a third-party connection pool library):
// (Assuming you have a connection pool library like HikariCP)

HikariDataSource dataSource = new HikariDataSource();
dataSource.setJdbcUrl(url);
dataSource.setUsername(username);
dataSource.setPassword(password);

Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();

// Use the connection object...

connection.close(); // Connection is returned to the pool
dataSource.close(); // Close the pool when finished

Error Handling (SQLException)

JDBC interactions can throw SQLException objects to signal errors. Always handle these exceptions to ensure proper application behavior and graceful recovery from database issues.

Additional Considerations

PreparedStatement: For queries with dynamic values, use PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Bind values using methods like setString(), setInt(), etc., instead of concatenating them directly into the query string.
Batch Processing: Improve performance for bulk inserts, updates, or deletes by using batch processing. Statements like addBatch() and executeBatch() allow you to group multiple operations and execute them efficiently.
Metadata: Use DatabaseMetaData and ResultSetMetaData objects to retrieve information about the database schema, tables, columns, and data types.


Advanced Concepts

RowSets: RowSet is an interface representing a set of database rows that can be disconnected from the database. This allows for caching results and manipulating them even after the connection is closed. Implementations like JdbcRowSet and CachedRowSet provide various functionalities.
Scrollable ResultSets: Standard ResultSet objects are typically forward-only, meaning you can only iterate through rows once from beginning to end. ScrollableResultSet (obtained by specifying the appropriate concurrency type when creating a Statement) allows you to move the cursor backward and forward within the result set.
Concurrency Control: JDBC provides mechanisms for controlling how concurrent transactions access and modify data. Concurrency levels (like READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, and SERIALIZABLE) determine the isolation level and potential for data inconsistencies.
XA (eXtended Architecture) Transactions: XA is a distributed transaction framework that allows transactions to span multiple databases managed by different transaction managers. It's relevant for complex enterprise applications with data across multiple databases.
Custom Data Types (UDTs): Some databases support User-Defined Types (UDTs) to represent complex data structures. JDBC provides interfaces like SQLData and Struct to work with UDTs in your application.
DatabaseMetaData and ResultSetMetaData: As mentioned earlier, these interfaces provide valuable metadata about the database schema, tables, columns, and data types. This information can be used for dynamic querying, schema introspection, and data type validation.
Best Practices

Connection Pooling: Always use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently and avoid creating and closing connections for each interaction.
PreparedStatement: For parameterized queries, leverage PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities and improve performance. Bind values separately using setter methods.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling using SQLException to catch and handle database errors gracefully. Provide informative error messages to users or logs.
Resource Management: Close ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects in the reverse order of creation to release resources promptly.
Transactions: Use transactions appropriately to maintain data consistency, especially for critical updates or deletions. Consider isolation levels based on your application's needs.
Batch Processing: For bulk data operations, utilize batch processing offered by Statement objects to improve efficiency and minimize round trips to the database.
